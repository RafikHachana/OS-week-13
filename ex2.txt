The 3 methods are used in different scenarios:

-Recovery:
It is used when the system is already caught in a deadlock, the only way is to either inform the user, kill a process that is part of the deadlock, or preempt a resource (take it away from one of the processes).

-Prevention:
This is implemented by preventing one of the four required conditions of deadlocks.
It is useful in systems where all resources may be requested at once.

-Avoidance:
This method uses algorithms to make sure the system is always in a safe state and cannot enter an unsafe state where it is in danger of a deadlock.
